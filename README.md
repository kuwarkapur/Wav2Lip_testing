# Wav2Lip_testing

This guide will walk you through the process of using Wav2Lip to synchronize audio with video, making it appear as though the subject in the video is speaking the audio. This can be especially useful for various video editing and dubbing purposes.

# Installation
Before you begin, you need to install the required software and dependencies:
FFmpeg-Python: A multimedia framework to handle video and audio.
Librosa: A Python package for audio analysis.

# Download Files
Next, you need the necessary files for the lip-syncing process:
Model Checkpoint (.pth): Download the model checkpoint file.
Video File: Download the video in which you want to sync the audio.
Now that you have everything you need, let's perform the lip-syncing:


# Run the inference script with your files
```
python inference.py --checkpoint_path '/path/to/wav2lip.pth' --face '/path/to/video.mp4' --audio '/path/to/audio.wav'
```
Replace /path/to/wav2lip.pth with the path to the downloaded model checkpoint, /path/to/video.mp4 with the path to the video file, and /path/to/audio.wav with the path to the audio file.
The script will generate an output video where the lip movements are synchronized with the provided audio.

Remember to adjust the file paths according to your system's directory structure.
